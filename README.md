# plant-seedling-classification-di-mono - a demo project of plant classification with ResNet18

This is a deep learning-based plant seedling classification project that utilizes **PyTorch** and **transfer learning** technology to automatically classify plant seedlings into **monocots** and **dicots**.

Feature
1. Fine-tuning using a pre-trained ResNet18 model
2. Techniques such as rotation, flipping, and color dithering were employed to enhance the model's robustness.
3. Achieved an accuracy rate of **98.21%** on the validation set.
4. Included visual Presentation of Baohanle Prediction Results
